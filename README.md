# Dependencies
- Needs at least python 3.6 or greater. You should check the version you have with : ```readlink -f`command -v python3` ```
- `bash`, `curl`, (linux only) `sha256sum`: generic POSIX utilities.

# Why
The Pre commit hooks seem popular and I would like to use them in as may projects as I can.
However, since it is python and we need pip to install, I would like to avoid that.

Further, since there is a convininent pyzip (pyz) I can use that.
And combined with asdf-vm the versioning is much easier.

# Install

Plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add pre-commit
# or
asdf plugin add https://github.com/comdotlinux/asdf-pre-commit.git
```

pre-commit:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all pre-commit

# Install specific version
asdf install pre-commit latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global pre-commit latest

# Now pre-commit commands are available
pre-commit -V
```

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to
install & manage versions.
